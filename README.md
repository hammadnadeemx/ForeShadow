# ForeShadow
Forshadow is a cache simulator currently under development. The aim of this project is to compare the performance of various prefetching techniques and eviction policies. Forshadow aims to have the ability to obtain memory traces of any program.
version history:

0.5 Added the ability to write the simulation process to file. Added a simple benchmark which provides memory traces
0.4 Added infrastructure for prefetchers and implemented a streambuffer prefetcher. 
0.3 Fixed some bugs and segmentation faults.
0.2 Added 6 eviction policies (LFU,LRU,LIFO,FIFO,RR,MRU).
0.1 Added direct mapped, set associative and fully associative classes
0.0 Laid the basic building blocks for a cache structure.
